                  My name is Anthony D'costa. I'm an B.S. student at University of Sample Computer Science and Mathematics Department. I was born and raised in Chandigarh, India. <br>
                  I did senior schooling from Chandigarh Convent School, India.  <br>
                  I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.
